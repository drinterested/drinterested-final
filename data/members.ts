  bio: "I started Dr. Interested after seeing too many youth struggle to navigate med school paths or build core skills like research and public speaking. This platform exists to change that—by giving students the tools and guidance they need to thrive. Beyond this, I’m a public speaker, youth advocate & changemaker! I lead initiatives that empower tens of thousands of young people, including founding Dr. Interested and contributing to the Play-to-Heal movement. I’ve supported youth-focused research and policy, including a CIHR grant with SickKids for the OPTIMAL Project and recommendations presented to the Future of Sport in Canada Commission. Passionate about mentorship, research, and leadership, I aim to create opportunities for youth to innovate and lead.
